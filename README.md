# ArcTouch
The project is a Single Page Application and was developed for ArcTouch's 'challenge coding'.

## Characteristics
The project was structured to be accessible from the most varied devices and the HTML tags are respecting semantics, helping accessibility. All components were built separately (using the BEM methodology), in a responsive way, to reach the mobile devices. JavaScript code was built without the use of libraries or frameworks. It was splitted in functions, avoiding manipulations and access to the DOM.

## Technical specifications
* Webpack - Task runner
* ES6 - ECMAScript
* Pug - Template engine
